        <h3>1.Shri Ballaleshwar</h3>
        <p class="city">Pali,Raigad</p>
        <p class="text">
          Ganesha is believed to have saved this boy-devotee, Ballala, who was
          beaten by local villagers and his father for his single-minded
          devotion to him. this is the only Ashtavinayak idol to be named after
          a Ganesha devotee. The prasad offered to this Ganesha is Besan Laadu
          instead of Modak, a sweet normally offered to other Ganapatis.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          This temple is situated inthe villade of Pali, 111 kms from Pune.
          Among the Ashtavinayaka, Ballal Vinayak at Pali is associated with the
          legend where Ganapati is said to have come to the aid of a young
          lad(Ballal), who was one of his fervent devotees. The image of Vinayak
          sits on a stone throne facing east, its trunk is left turned. Diamonds
          are embedded in the eyes and navel. The background, made of silver,
          features Riddho and Siddhi waving chamaras. The idol in this temple is
          the only avatar in which Lord Ganesha is seen wearing traditional
          Indian clothes. This is because he appeared to Ballal in the form of a
          Brahmin. Shri Ballaleshwar is the only incarnation of Lord Ganesha
          which is known by a devotee's name.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          The original wooden temple was renovated and a new stone temple was
          built in 1760 AD. Its shape is in the form of the letter 'shri', and
          it faces east. During Dakshinayan at sunrise, the sun's rays fall
          exactly on the Vinayak idol, resulting in a truly glorious sight.

        <p class="text">
          This idol of Lord Ganesha was found in a lake outside the sanctum of
          the temple. Since it was in a bad condition, the temple trustees
          immersed the idol and consecrated a new one inside the sanctum. The
          original idol of Varadvinayaka can be seen outside the sanctum. Both
          idols are located in two corners-the idol on the left is smeared in
          vermilion with its trunk turned left, and the idol on the right is
          made of white marble with its trunk turned to the right. The sanctum
          is made of stone and is surrounded by beautiful stone elephant
          carvings which house the idol. Two stone idols of Riddhi and Siddhi
          can also be seen in the sanctum.

        <h3>5. Shri Siddhivinayaka</h3>
        <p class="city">Siddhatek,Pune</p>
        <p class="text">
          God Vishnu is supposed to have vanquished the aseras Madhu and Kaitabh
          after propitiating Ganesha here. This is the only idol of the eight
          Ashtavinayakas with the trunk positioned to its right.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Siddhatek lies in Karjat Taluka (Ahmednagar District), on the banks of
          River Bhima, 96 kms from Pune. Legend has it that Siddhivinayaka came
          to the aid of Mahavishnu as he was engaged in a long battle with the
          demons Madhu and Kaitabha. It is believed that the original temple was
          built by Lord Vishnu and a new temple was built during the reign of
          the Peshwas.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          The idol of Lord Ganesha is one metre tall, facing north with its
          trunk turned right. This form is considered to be the most vibrant
          form of Lord Ganesha. The idol is placed in a brass frame with brass
          staues of Jay and Vijay on both sides. Contrary to the pictorial
          depiction of Lord Ganesha in Hinde mythology, the belly of the
          Siddhivinayaka idol is not big.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Lord Ganesha is enshrined in a sitting posture, with his consorts
          Riddhi and Siddhi sittinf on one lap. The face is very calm and
          serene, and the Pradakshana (encircling) of this God is said to be
          very fruitful. Devotees have to travel 5 kms to complete one
          Pradakshana, as the idol is attaches to the hill itself.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Shri Siddhivinayaka's temple is on a hilltop, facing north. The
          sanctum of the temple is five metres high and three metres broad. In
          the sanctum is a Shivapanchayatan and a small temple of Goddess
          Shivai. Besides the Siddhivinayaka idol, the temple houses the idols
          of Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva. Moving towards the Siddhivinayaka
          shrine is a place where Sage Vyasa had performed yagna (sacrifices),
          but the place is now coveres by water.

        <h3>6.Shri Mahaganapati</h3>
        <p class="city">Ranjangaon,Ahmednagar</p>
        <p class="text">
          Shiva is believed to have worshipped Ganesha before fighting the demon
          Tripurasura here. Constructed so that the rays of the sun fall
          directly in the idol (suring the Southward movemnet of the sun), the
          temple bears a distinct resemblance to the architecture reminiscent of
          the 9th and 10th Centuried
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Ranjangaon is located on the Pune-Ahmednagar Highway, 50 kms from
          Pune. Mahaganapati is believed to have come to the aid of Shiva in
          destroying the citadels of the demon Tripurasura.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Facing east, the idol is in a cross-legged sitting position with its
          trunk turned towards the left. Mahaganapati is believed to have ten
          hands, and the idol here has ten hands and twenty trunks. The
          Mahaganapati is portayed seated on a lotus, flanked by his consorts
          Siddhi and Riddhi.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          The temple faces east and has a huge, beautiful gate with statues of
          two doorkeepers, namely Jay and Vijay, at the entrance. It has been
          constructed in such a way that the sun's rays fall directly on Lord
          Ganesha's idol.

        <h3>7.Shri Vigneshwara</h3>
        <p class="city">Ozar,nashik</p>
        <p class="text">
          The demon Vighasur, after being degeated by Lord Ganesha pleaded to
          show mercy. Ganesha granted his plea, but on the consition that demon
          should not go to the place where Ganesha worshipping is going on. In
          return the demon asked a favour that his name should be taken before
          Ganesha's name, thus the name os Ganesha became Vighnaharta or
          Vighneshwara
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Ozar is located 85 kms from Pune, in Junnar Taluka. It is said that
          Lord Ganesha killed a demon named Vigneshwara here, hence the name
          Vigneshwara Vinayak. According to mythilogy, Lord. Ganesha travels on
          the back of a mouse and so, this temple also enshrines the idol of a
          mouse. Along with the divine idol of Lord Ganesha, the temple also has
          multiple structures that reflect the artistic value of the shrine.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          The idol of Vigneshwara Vinayak faces rast and its trunk turns towards
          the left. It is smeared in vermilion mixed with oil and has
          emerald-studded eyes. The idol also features a diamond on its forehead
          and in its navel. On either side if the idol are brass statues of
          Riddhi and Siddhi.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          The east-facing Vigneshwara temple is surrounded on four sides by a
          protective stone wall. At the entrance are two stone pillars for oil
          lamps and two huge Dvarapala (door guards) carved in stone. The main
          temple has two halls, one with a statue of Dhundiraj and the other
          with an idol of a mouse in a running position made of white marble.
          After passing through two pandals, there is a third pandal where Lord
          Vigneshwara's idol is installed. Murtis Panchatatan (Sun, Shiva,
          Vishnu, Goddess, Ganapati) are situated in four corners of the
          sanctum. The temple, which has a golden dome and pinnacle, is
          considered an architectural marvel.

        <h3>8.Shri Girijatmajavinayaka</h3>
        <p class="city">Lenyadri,Nashik</p>
        <p class="text">
          It is believed that Parvati (Lord Shiva's wife) performed penance to
          beget Ganesha at this point. This temple stands amidst a cave complex
          of 18 caves of Buddhist origin. This temple is the 8th cave. These are
          called Ganesh-Leni as well.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Lenyadri is situated on the North-West bank of River Kukadi, 94 kms
          from Pune. The Ganesha Puran calls this place Jirnapur or Lekhan
          Parbat. This is the only temple of the Ashtavinayaka which is on a
          mountain and is set in a Buddhist cave-temple. There are 18 caves
          here, all of Buddhist origin, which date back to the 3rd century.
          Girijatmajavinayaka enshrined in the eighth cave is believed to be a
          manifestation of Lord Ganesha as an infant.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Girijatmaja's idol, with its trunk turned to the left, faces east with
          Shivashankar and Hanuman at its sides. The idol is not a separate and
          distinct statue; it has been carved on a stone wall of the cave.
          Previously, the God was overed with armour, which has since fallen. In
          this small sanctum, devotees can perform Girijatmaja's puja on their
          own.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          283 steps take you up to this magnificent temple, which was carved out
          of a single stone. In front of the main mandir is a huge sabhamandap
          (hall), which is nearly 18 metres ong and about 17 metres broad. It is
          about 2 metres high, and has six stone pillars decorated with carving
          of cows, elephants, etc.

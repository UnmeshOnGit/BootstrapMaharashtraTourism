    <p>Maharashtra is the land of the great Maratha warrior <i>Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj</i>, who once fought bravely against the mighty Mughal Empire. The valor of Maharashtra’s son Shivaji continues to echo in the strong royal forts nestled inside it.Forts in Maharashtra were built during the times when India was under the foreign rule of the Mughals. Shivaji Maharaj brought the technique of guerrilla warfare and personally designed many of the Maharashtra forts.Today, after centuries forts of Maharashtra have stood the test of time and weather, they stood the torrential rains, they stood blaze, and they stood dryness of weather along with the blood of enemies and the warriors likewise.</p>
    <p>I am proud of the famous Maharashtra forts. In the list of forts in Maharashtra, many forts are won by Shivaji Maharaj. Some of these forts are <i>Panhala, Raigarh, Murud Janjira, Sindhudurg, and Vijayadurg</i>.Each year millions of tourists visit Maharashtra’s strong forts built by Shivaji Maharaj or won by Shivaji Maharaj to witness the visual pieces of evidence of victories and history, not by Shivaji Maharaj alone but, those of the foreign rulers as well. Many of Maharashtra forts are built by Shivaji Maharaj to strengthen the kingdom of Maharashtra.</p><hr><br>

    <h3>Shivneri Fort</h3>
    <p>Shivneri Fort is the birthplace of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj who was the founder of the Maratha Empire. This association has made the fort a sacred location and the government has declared Shivneri Killa as a protected monument. The history of Shivneri fort is honored to witness the birth of Shivaji on 19th February 1630.As Shahaji Raje, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s father, was concerned about the safety of his wife Jijabai when she was pregnant he decided to trust the Shivneri Killa and shifted Jijabai here. Not only this, Shivneri Fort still cherishes the moments when Shivaji used to play here during his childhood.Shivneri Killa is triangular in shape and it has several rock-hewn cisterns and ponds. The important quality of two of its ponds called Ganges and Yamuna is that they have water throughout the year. The tourists are awe-struck by the dazzling beauty of the ponds at Shivneri Fort.</p>
    <p>Recently the house where Shivaji Maharaj was born has been restored and looks amazing. The addition of a temple called Shivakunja with statues of Shivaji and Jijabai is marvelous and breathtaking.</p>
    <p>
    Shivneri Killa was completely flattered when Sir Richard Temple remarked about Shivneri fort saying, “You will see what a rugged precipitous place this is and what a fitting spot it was for a hero to be born in!”
    </p><p> 
        The best thing is Shivneri Killa is just 90 Kms. from Pune and easily accessible. Other features, which make the fort charming and appealing, include Badami Talav that is situated right in the center. Then there is a temple dedicated to Goddess Shivai, after whom Shivaji was named.
    </p>  <p>
